Hello, I'm glad that you visited here. My name is Wojciech Stanis≈Çawski and it's my first C++ game (I used SFML libray, version 2.4). Project is made in Ubuntu 16.04. While writting I mainly supported to informations contained on website http://www.sfml-dev.org/learn.php (tutorial and API documentation). If you have any problems with building project on your own computer I recommend to look at tutorial, which I used: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.4/#getting-started. Just click on your IDE/system under "Getting started" title. Installation and configuration are well described on SFML's official tutorial. If you have any questions about "tic tac toe" or other projects, or just want to contact with me, don't hesistate to write to me on woj.stanislawski@gmail.com. Regards.
